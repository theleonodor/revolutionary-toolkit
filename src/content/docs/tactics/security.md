# Safety & Security

Comprehensive guide to security culture, digital privacy, and operational security practices for organizers and activists. Security culture protects individuals and strengthens movements.

## What Is Security Culture?

Security culture is a set of practices, attitudes, and knowledge that helps protect individuals and organizations from surveillance, infiltration, and repression. It's not paranoiaâ€”it's practical preparation based on documented historical patterns of state and corporate interference with social movements.

### Core Principles

1. **Need to Know Basis**: Only share sensitive information with people who need it for their role
2. **Compartmentalization**: Separate different types of activities and information
3. **Assumption of Surveillance**: Assume communications may be monitored
4. **Collective Responsibility**: Everyone's security practices affect the whole group
5. **Balanced Approach**: Security measures should enhance, not hinder, organizing effectiveness

## Digital Security

### Secure Communications

**Encrypted Messaging:**
- **Signal**: End-to-end encrypted messaging, voice, and video calls
  - Enable disappearing messages for sensitive conversations
  - Verify safety numbers for important contacts
  - Use relay calls to hide your phone number
- **Wire**: Alternative to Signal with similar features
- **Briar**: Peer-to-peer messaging that works without internet

**Email Security:**
- **ProtonMail** or **Tutanota**: Encrypted email providers
- **GPG/PGP**: Email encryption for existing accounts
- **Temporary Emails**: Use for one-time registrations

**Group Communications:**
- **Signal Groups**: For small, trusted groups
- **Encrypted Chat Rooms**: Element/Matrix for larger groups
- **Avoid**: Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, SMS, regular email for sensitive topics

### Device Security
