# Guerrilla Warfare: Strategic and Tactical Guide
*Based on Che Guevara's Manual*

## Overview

Guerrilla warfare is fundamentally **a war of the masses, a war of the people**. The guerrilla band serves as the combative vanguard of the people, drawing its strength from mass support. This guide extracts the key strategic and tactical principles from Che Guevara's seminal work on guerrilla warfare theory.

:::note[Golden Rule]
**No battle, combat, or skirmish should be fought unless it can be won.**
:::

## Three Fundamental Lessons

Based on the Cuban Revolution experience:

### 1. Popular Forces Can Win Against Professional Armies
- Small, determined groups can defeat larger, better-equipped forces
- Popular support compensates for material disadvantages

### 2. Revolutionary Conditions Can Be Created
- Don't wait for "perfect" conditions
- The insurrectional focus (foco) can develop subjective conditions based on existing objective conditions

### 3. Countryside is the Primary Arena
- In underdeveloped countries, rural areas provide ideal conditions for guerrilla struggle
- Agrarian reform becomes the central banner of struggle

## Core Principles

### The Essence of Guerrilla Warfare

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Popular Support**: Indispensable condition - guerrillas must have full support of local people
- **Social Reform**: Guerrilla fighter is a social reformer taking up arms against oppression
- **Mobility**: Constant movement and flexibility are essential
- **Surprise**: Every operation must utilize the element of surprise

"The people are to the guerrilla fighters what water is to a fish - their means of existence."

## The Seven Golden Rules

1. **Don't engage in fights that can't be won**
2. **Move continuously - hit and run**
3. **Use the enemy as main supplier of weapons**
4. **Hide your movements**
5. **Make use of surprise in military actions**
6. **Form new columns once power is gained**
7. **Proceed through three phases**: strategic defense → balance → total annihilation

## Strategic Framework

### Overall Strategy
**Goal**: Complete destruction of opposing forces through phases of development

**Phases of Development:**
1. **Survival Phase**: Avoid annihilation, build support
2. **Growth Phase**: Gradual weakening of enemy forces
3. **Offensive Phase**: Transform into conventional warfare

### Enemy Analysis
**Assess enemy capabilities:**
- Personnel strength and mobility
- Popular support levels
- Armaments and equipment
- Leadership capacity
- Supply lines and communications

### Resource Acquisition
- **Primary source of arms**: Enemy forces
- Choose weapons compatible with enemy equipment
- Ammunition scarcity is the greatest challenge

## Tactical Operations

### The "Minuet" Tactic
- Surround enemy position from four points
- 5-6 guerrillas at each point, far enough to avoid encirclement
- Attack from one point, retreat when enemy responds
- Attack from different point, repeat process
- Forces enemy to expend ammunition while wearing down morale

### Ambush Operations
- **Location**: One day's march from regular camp
- **Timing**: Preferably at night
- **Preparation**: 2-4 days of supplies for extended operations
- **Target**: Enemy columns, especially vanguards
- **Withdrawal**: Always planned and executed systematically

### Fire Discipline
- **Guerrilla pattern**: Methodical, sporadic, accurate fire
- **Enemy pattern**: Violent, rapid firing
- **Principle**: Every bullet counts - economy is essential

## Terrain Considerations

### Favorable Terrain (Mountains, Dense Forests)
**Advantages:**
- Natural protection and concealment
- Difficult enemy access
- Better defensive positions

**Operations:**
- Can engage in longer battles
- Possible to establish bases and small industries
- Daytime operations more feasible
- Less mobility required

**Recommended Force**: 100-150 guerrillas per column

### Unfavorable Terrain (Plains, Open Areas)
**Challenges:**
- High visibility and vulnerability
- Rapid enemy response capability
- Limited hiding places

**Adaptations:**
- **Maximum mobility**: 30-50 km night marches
- **Smaller units**: 10-15 guerrillas maximum
- **Night operations**: Almost exclusively nocturnal
- **Rapid strikes**: Quick, violent attacks followed by immediate withdrawal

### Urban Warfare
**Special Characteristics:**
- Never independent operations
- Always under direct command from other zones
- Maximum 4-5 guerrillas per unit
- Focus on sabotage rather than combat
- Extremely limited mobility and hiding options

## Organization Structure

### Command Hierarchy
- **Commander-in-Chief**: Overall leadership
- **Zone Commanders**: Regional authority
- **Column Commanders**: Tactical units (100-150 fighters)
- **Captains**: Platoons (30-40 fighters)
- **Lieutenants**: Squads (8-12 fighters)

### Squad Organization
- **Basic functional unit**: 8-12 fighters
- **Leadership succession**: Clear chain of command established
- **Operational independence**: Can function separately when needed

### Support Elements
- **Medical personnel**: Combat medics and field hospitals
- **Supply teams**: Transportation and logistics
- **Intelligence network**: Local contacts and information gathering
- **Communication specialists**: Radio and messenger services

## Supply and Logistics

### Supply Principles
1. **Always pay for supplies** from friendly sources
2. **Use "bonds of hope"** when cash unavailable
3. **Establish collective plantings** in liberated territory
4. **Develop local industries**: food, shoes, leather goods

### Essential Supplies
**Food:**
- Basic starches (corn, rice, wheat, potatoes)
- Protein sources (meat, preserved fish)
- Salt (absolutely essential)
- Fats and oils
- Sugar and canned goods

**Equipment:**
- Weapons and ammunition
- Medical supplies
- Communication equipment
- Tools and materials for small industries

### Supply Lines
**Internal Lines**: Within guerrilla territory
- Series of safe houses and waypoints

## Intelligence and Communication

### Intelligence Network
**Sources:**
