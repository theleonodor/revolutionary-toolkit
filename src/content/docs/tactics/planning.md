# Planning & Organization

Effective organizing requires strategic thinking, clear planning, and strong organizational structures. This section covers proven frameworks for strategic planning, different organizational models, and practical coordination methods.

## Strategic Planning Fundamentals

### Power Analysis

**Understanding Power Dynamics:**
Power analysis is the foundation of strategic planning. Before developing tactics, you must understand how power operates in your specific context.

**Types of Power:**
- **Institutional Power**: Formal authority (government, corporations, organizations)
- **Economic Power**: Control over resources, jobs, money
- **Social Power**: Influence through relationships and networks
- **Cultural Power**: Ability to shape narratives and values
- **Coercive Power**: Use of force or threat of force
- **Expert Power**: Knowledge, skills, and information

**Power Mapping Exercise:**
1. **Identify Key Players**: Who has power to make the changes you want?
2. **Assess Influence**: How much influence does each player have?
3. **Map Relationships**: How are different power holders connected?
4. **Find Pressure Points**: Where can you apply leverage effectively?
5. **Identify Allies**: Who shares your interests or could be persuaded?

**Questions for Power Analysis:**
- Who has the formal authority to make the decision you want?
- Who influences the decision-makers?
- What do the decision-makers care about most?
- What would motivate them to act in your favor?
- What are their vulnerabilities or pressure points?

### Strategic Planning Framework

**Vision and Goals:**
- **Long-term Vision**: What does success look like in 10-20 years?

A theory of change connects your activities to your desired outcomes through a logical chain of cause and effect.

1. **Root Causes**: What are the underlying causes of the problem?
2. **Assumptions**: What assumptions underlie your strategy?
